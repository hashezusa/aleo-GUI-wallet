# Aleo Wallet Requirements

## Account Structure
An Aleo wallet must manage three key components for each account:

1. **Account Private Key**
   - Format: Base58 string (59 characters)
   - Prefix: `APrivateKey1`
   - Example: `APrivateKey1zkp4X9ApjTb7Rv8EABfZRugXBhbPzCL245GyNtYJP5GYY2k`
   - Purpose: Authorizes transactions, updates global state of account records
   - Security: Should never be disclosed to third parties

2. **Account View Key**
   - Format: Base58 string (53 characters)
   - Prefix: `AViewKey1`
   - Example: `AViewKey1nKB4qr9b5gK8wQvmM5sTPEuBwshtDdkCZB1SPWppAG9Y`
   - Purpose: Decrypts account records from the global ledger
   - Security: Should only be shared with authorized parties (e.g., auditors)

3. **Account Address**
   - Format: Bech32 string (63 characters)
   - Prefix: `aleo1`
   - Example: `aleo1dg722m22fzpz6xjdrvl9tzu5t68zmypj5p74khlqcac0gvednygqxaax0j`
   - Purpose: Allows users to transfer value and record data to one another

## Core Functionality Requirements

### Account Management
- Generate new Aleo accounts (private key, view key, address)
- Import existing accounts via private key
- Export accounts (with proper security measures)
- Support multiple accounts within one wallet
- Display account balances and transaction history

### Transaction Management
- Create and sign transactions
- Send funds to other Aleo addresses
- View incoming transactions
- Display transaction status and confirmations
- Support for transaction fees

### Record Management
- View and manage records associated with the account
- Decrypt records using the view key
- Track spent and unspent records

### Security Features
- Encryption of private keys in storage
- Password protection for wallet access
- Optional backup and recovery mechanisms
- Warning systems for potentially dangerous operations

## API Integration Requirements

### Blockchain Interaction
The wallet must interact with the Aleo blockchain using the RPC API, which includes methods for:

#### Blocks
- Get latest block height and hash
- Get block details
- Get state root

#### Transactions
- Get transaction details
- Generate transactions
- Get public transactions for an address

#### Records
- Get records generated within blocks
- Verify record ownership
- Get specific records by transition ID and index

#### Programs
- Get program source code
- Get program types
- Get transactions for programs

#### NFTs and Tokens
- Get public NFTs for an address
- Get public token programs for an address

#### Staking
- Get staked balance for an address

## User Interface Requirements

### Visual Identity
- Use the same logo and color scheme as the Aleo mining software
- Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) for primary elements
- Teal (#0D9488) for accents
- Gold (#F59E0B) for important indicators
- Support for both dark mode and light mode

### Attribution
- Display "Created by Magnafic0 Unchained"
- Display "Powered by CryptoNebula"

### Usability
- Simple, intuitive interface for non-technical users
- Clear labeling of all functions
- Confirmation dialogs for sensitive operations
- Helpful error messages
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Requirements

### Scalability
- Modular architecture to allow for future enhancements
- Support for upcoming Aleo features and updates
- Performance optimization for handling large numbers of records

### Compatibility
- Windows operating system support
- Consistent with Aleo mining software environment

## Implementation Considerations

### Security Best Practices
- Never expose private keys to network
- Minimize attack surface
- Follow cryptographic best practices
- Implement proper input validation

### Privacy Features
- Support Aleo's privacy-preserving features
- Enable users to control visibility of their transactions
- Respect zero-knowledge proof principles

This document serves as the foundation for developing the first GUI wallet for Aleo, ensuring it meets all necessary requirements while maintaining consistency with the existing mining software.
